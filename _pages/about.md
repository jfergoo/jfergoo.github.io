I am a mathematician working on theoretical and computational models of natural phenomena.

Currently I am a postdoctoral scientist based in the [Vogels Lab](https://ista.ac.at/en/research/vogels-group/) at the [Institute of Science and Technology Austria](https://ista.ac.at). 

Thanks for visiting my website!
